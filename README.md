# Tic Tac Toe
## Description
This is an implementation of tic tac toe on C. Currently, it features a local two-player mode in which players take turns entering their moves unitl either someone wins, or a tie is reached.
## How to Play
1. Clone the most recent version to your machine
> git clone https://github.com/andrew-hayworth22/TicTacToe.git
2. In the newly cloned repository, run the following commands
> make tictactoe
> ./tictactoe
## Future Plans
I plan to create a multiplayer mode that will allow one terminal to host a server that other terminals can join and play
